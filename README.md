# YourSystem - Public Website

## Purpose
This project consists on the development of the **YourSystem** public website where all the information about the company, team, ambitions, ideas, contacts and others will be available for every user. Making it a fast and good looking website where modern technologies are used and the best programming practices are put into place, making our open-source project a good one for any developer that may help us or help themselves.

## Techonology
Using modern and new technologies is the favorite hobby of YourSystem, so the framework used to develop the website is **Angular**, for the front-end, and, if needed, **Python** for the back-end. For deployment matters, **Docker** will be used to it's fullest.

## Objectives
To make our information accessible to each and every person on the internet, the YourSystem team decided to build and develop an open-source public website with defined objectives for it's creation and deployment, them being:
- Develop an **attractive simple website**, where information is displayed clearly.
- Make the website scalable and create a template that may be used for future projects.
- Use **simple and fast** programming methods rather than complex and slower ones.
- Reach the public about **who we are**, **our ambitions** and **our ideas**.

## Contributing
In order to contribute, you need to first have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed and follow the instructions to use it on the repository.

Secondly, no commit should **ever** be done in the _master_ branch, which means for every feature, improvement, bugfix or others, there must be created a branch for that case and, when the feature is finished, a pull request should be opened and then reviewed by a member, other than the one that developed the branch.

A branch name should go by *type_of_branch*/*name_of_branch*, branches created that not follow this format won't be considered and deleted. The name of the branch should be simple and short and all commits should be equally simple and explicit, not excedding the recommend character limit (72 characters).

The types of branches (*type_of_branch*) recommended to be used are:
- **feature** // for new features and functionalities.
- **improvement** // for improvement in existing functionalities.
- **bugfix** // for fixing some bugs that may exist.
